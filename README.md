A micro service framework based on MQ

Kael the Invoker is a hero from Dota Allstars, who owns just three fundamental elements but can create numerous tremendous skills because of his magic power.

This micro service framework, which works the same way as Kael does, turns limited process resources to unlimited kinds of services with controlling and managing.

Yet it's not the only ability our kael capable of, kael can also deploy services with specific version and location. We hope kael can help set us developers free from messy distributed deploying.
